Hi,

I would like to say thank you for giving me a chance to present my work.
I made this webbapp for less than 2hours since I only download a template UI, I made this app
using vanilla JS with jQuery and raw PHP with my own MVC setup.


**To Note
[Menu Registry and Stocks Movement]
	- Upon adding a Menu the user must select a category and input tax.
	- Menu Code is the only searchable query for the searchbar
	- When adding stocks go to 'Goods Receive' for adding inventory
[Ordering]
	- Upon Clicking the 'Order' in the Side menu it will automatically create Invoice Number
	- Upon Clicking the 'Pay' button it will create the OR Number
	- Upon entering the cuopon code, must click enter to register the code

Thank you,
Jian Jaico Cajita
